Title: Exploratory Analysis and Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction using Python

Abstract: This research project aims to develop an accurate model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using Python. The study employs various techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing methods, and the integration of two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression, to evaluate the prediction accuracy.

The prediction model considers several key variables, namely 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Skin Thickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'Diabetes Pedigree Function', 'Age', and 'Outcome'. These variables play a crucial role in assessing the risk and probability of diabetes occurrence in individuals.

The experimental results demonstrate a prediction accuracy of approximately 75% for both the KNN and Logistic Regression algorithms. However, it is important to note that this study utilizes a relatively small dataset consisting of 768 rows and 9 columns. For larger datasets, further investigation into the relationships between variables and advanced data modeling techniques is strongly recommended to enhance the predictive performance and generalizability of the model.
